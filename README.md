# SageSmith üß†

**An Interactive Philosophy Simulator**

---

Welcome to **SageSmith**, a unique and ambitious project designed to make philosophy engaging and accessible by simulating debates between iconic historical philosophers. Users can explore moral, political, and societal dilemmas through reasoned, multi-perspective dialogues that bring to life the voices of Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche, Confucius, Simone de Beauvoir, and more.

## üåü Key Features (Planned & Ongoing)

- Simulated multi-philosopher panel or debate-style responses  
- Support for uploading dilemmas, articles, or real case studies  
- GPT-4 powered AI grounded in real philosophical texts using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with citation-backed responses  
- Response modes tailored for learners: *‚ÄúTeach me like I‚Äôm 15‚Äù* vs. *‚ÄúGraduate-level‚Äù* explanations  
- Timeline visualization showing the evolution of philosophical ideas over time  
- Dialectical mode allowing philosophers to critique and engage with each other's views

## üöÄ Tech Stack

### Backend

- **FastAPI** (Python) for building a performant, asynchronous REST API  
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API** via LangChain for powerful AI-driven dialogue simulation  
- **Pinecone** (or FAISS) as a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Embedding and knowledge chunking for grounding responses in real philosophical texts  
- Environment & secrets management via `.env`  
- Vector index persistence and efficient retrieval  

### Frontend

- **Next.js** (React) for a modern, SEO-friendly web app  
- **TypeScript** for robust type safety  
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui** for sleek, responsive, and accessible UI components  
- Interactive dialogue panels and timeline visualization components  
- Modular and extensible design for future AI integration
